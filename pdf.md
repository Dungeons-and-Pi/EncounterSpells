## About

We felt like the  default Compendium was too small. This module is built on the [open5e](https://open5e.com){.blue} project, aiming to be the best open-source resource for 5e content. So using their API, we have been slowly converting data for [EncounterPlus iOS app](https://encounter.plus/){.blue}. The PDF version of this module use D&D Beyond Entries for it's resources so, some links are broken but at least they are there.
