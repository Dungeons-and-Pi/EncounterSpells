            <p>We felt like the  default Compendium was too small. This module is built on the <a href="https://open5e.com" class="blue">open5e</a> project, aiming to be the best open-source resource for 5e content. So using their API, we have been slowly converting data for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/encounterplus-for-d-d-5e/id1170693487" class="blue">EncounterPlus iOS app</a>. The PDF version of this module use D&amp;D Beyond Entries for it’s resources so, some links are broken but at least they are there.</p>
